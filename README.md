Skedaddler tells when the X hours of your work day is over based on the given arrival time, possible flex and non-worktime breaks.

## Available Settings

* Work day length can be adjusted in the settings with default being 8 hours.
* Arrival time auto adjust modifies the arrival time when it is automatically refreshed (on startup or by auto refresh)
* Auto refresh arrival time when the program notices the day has changed. Useful when sleeping the computer, the value will be updated on wake up.
